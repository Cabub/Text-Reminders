# Privacy Policy for SMS Reminder App

*Last Updated: May 18, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the SMS Reminder App ("we," "our," or "the app") handles information when you use our application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure user experience.

## Information Collection and Use

### Personal Information

The SMS Reminder App operates entirely on your device and does not collect or transmit personal information to external servers:

- **Message Content**: Any message templates you create are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.
- **Recipient Phone Numbers**: Phone numbers you enter are only used to send SMS messages via your device's messaging capabilities and are not stored permanently outside the app's local storage.

## Data Storage and Retention

- **Local Storage**: All data entered in the app is stored locally on your device and is not backed up to our servers.
- **Data Retention**: The app retains information only for as long as necessary to provide its functionality. You can delete app data at any time through your device settings.

## App Permissions

SMS Reminder App requires certain permissions to function:

- **SMS Permission**: Required to send text messages from your device. This is essential for the app's core functionality.
- **Contacts Permission** (Optional): If implemented, this would only be requested when you choose to select recipients from your contact list.

## Third-Party Services

While our app doesn't directly collect data, third parties involved in the app's operation may collect information:

### Mobile Carriers

When you send SMS messages through our app, your mobile carrier processes these messages according to their terms of service and privacy policies, which typically includes:

- Recording metadata about messages (time sent, recipient, etc.)
- Storing message content as required by applicable regulations
- Billing for messaging services according to your plan

We recommend consulting your carrier's privacy policy for details on how they handle SMS data.

### App Distribution

Our app is distributed through platforms such as Google Play Store and F-Droid, which may collect:

- Download and installation statistics
- App update information
- Device information for compatibility purposes
- Aggregated, anonymous usage data

For more information, please refer to the respective privacy policies of these distribution platforms:
- [Google Play Store Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [F-Droid Privacy Policy](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Privacy_Policy/)

## Your Rights and Choices

You have control over your data within the app:

- **Access and Deletion**: You can access all data stored by the app through the app interface. You can clear the app's data or uninstall the app to remove all associated information.
- **Permissions Management**: You can grant or revoke permissions through your device settings at any time.

## Security

Your data security is inherently protected by the design of our app. Since your information remains solely on your device and is not transmitted to external servers (except when sending SMS messages via your carrier), the app does not introduce additional security vulnerabilities beyond those already present in your device's standard SMS functionality.

## Children's Privacy

Our app is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete this information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of material changes by posting the new policy on our GitHub repository and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the app.
